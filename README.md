# Emulate-a-O.S.-enviroment-using-pygame

##In what does it consist?
We will be using pygame to emulate (in this case), a custom Operating Systems's Desktop enviroment.
pygam e has many applications and functionalities, nonetheless we will be using only 3 of the wide array of options. These will be: loading screens with pygame.image.load, arranging icons scaling images that can be interacted with with: pygame.transform.load/scale and pygame.mixer which we'll be using to reproduce .mp3 files.

##Note:
If your'e interested in following the exact same steps to recreate this programm, or want to just copy paste this project, please be aware that there will have to be in the same file as the python program all the .png's and .mp3's that are going to be used.
